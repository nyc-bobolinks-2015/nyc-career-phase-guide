#What's Your Story
Being able to tell the story of your career transition is crucial to the success of your job search. 

Things to think about in preparing to tell your story:
<ul>
<li>Why now?</li>
<li>Why Dev?</li>
<li>What experiences are you bringing with you to the industry?</li>
<li>Who are you as a developer</li>
<li>What about your career journey is memorable?</li>
</ul>

In this exercise, you will craft:
<ul>
<li>A one sentence, high level introduction to who you are as a developer and career changer.</li>
<li>A three sentence introduction to who you are as a developer and career changer with a little more depth than the one sentence intro.</li>
<li>A three paragraph overview of who you are, how you got here, and your future ambitions as a developer and contributor to the tech workforce.</li>
</ul>

###How will these be used?
These introductions and overviews will be used in several different places. We'll be molding these to your resumes, LinkedIn profiles, cover letters, personal websites, and eventually we will learn how to turn these into two minute elevator pitches.
