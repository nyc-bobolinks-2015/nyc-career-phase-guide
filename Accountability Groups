#Accountability Groups
We ask all graduates to actively participate in their assigned Careers Accountability Groups until everyone in their group is employed per the [Graduate Agreement form](https://www.hellosign.com/s/b4066212) you signed to opt into Career Services.

Your Groups are:

* Connor, Kenneth, Joshua
* Jasmine, Matt B., Nicholas, Josh N.
* Andrew, Matt G., Jay, Spencer

In order to have successful meetings we suggest setting an agenda, expectations for meeting outcomes, and alternating who will faciliate each meeting (each of you should lead at least one meeting).

Career coaches have built out agendas and meeting notes for the first five weeks out of the program.
