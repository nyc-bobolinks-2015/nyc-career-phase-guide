#Career Week Phase Guide

Congratulations on graduating the program and welcome to Career Week!

Career Week will help you build a foundation for your post-DBC job search. The tools we cover throughout the week are best practices. There is no silver bullet to job searching, but we share tactics that graduates have found most effective.

For Career Week to be most effective, you are expected to attend all Career Week workshops and participate actively in all activities.This is also something you are agreeing to upon signing [Graduate Agreement form](https://www.hellosign.com/s/b4066212).

A few things you’ll be accountable for completing: Graduate Information Form (pre-career week), the Career Week Feedback Form (after Career Week), and the Employment Verification Form (post-employment).

Career Week runs from Monday to Friday the week after Graduation. Each day, Career Week starts at 10:00am and ends at 5:00pm with lunch running from 11:30 am - 1:00 pm. Yes, we still participate in 1:00 pm standups.

### Job Search Expectations
Your job search is going to feel weird. Lean into it. There are going to be high highs and low lows. The great part is you’re going to go through the extremes together as a cohort. Your ability to support one another will help smooth out the highs and lows of a prolonged search.

Stay active with your coding projects during the job! You have learned a lot over the last 9-15 weeks onsite, but it’s all short-term memory. Use it or you'll lose it! You will need to balance your job search with growing as a developer. We'll be focusing on how to manage your time to balance everything!

Graduating from DBC is tough, but finding a job is even tougher. Career Week provides tools that help grads search smarter, not harder. So breathe, get support, and get ready to lean in!

##Prep Work
* [Graduate Agreement form](https://www.hellosign.com/s/b4066212) needs to be signed before we start at 10am Monday morning.
* [This activity](./Resources/WCIYP) will be the first workshop Monday morning. Be sure to complete the Petal Exercise from Chapter 7 over the weekend leading up to career week.

###Activities

* [Chapter 7](./Resources/WCIYP/Ch 7 - What Color Is Your Parachute 2015.pdf)
* [Printable Petal Exercise](./Resources/WCIYP/Blank Flower Diagram.pdf)

Pro tips for this exercise:

* Spend ~15-20 minutes on each petal (there are seven), you can always come back to one or two later on
* Ignore the prioritizing grid, it's too time consuming
* Petal 3 can be a time suck. Think of several scenarios but don't feel the need to come up with​ seven​ detailed ones, the skills are more important than separate situations to pull them from.
* Petal 5 is a good basic financial planning exercise, if you haven't gone through something like it recently, it could be helpful
* ​Petal 7 is deep - ​read over the prompt, give yourself time to reflect and come up with your "kingdom.​"

Here's [the schedule](./Resources/Grasshopper_2015_Career_Week_Schedule.pdf) for this week.
