#What's Your Story, Continued.
You've spent all week creating and perfecting the passive tools, practicing the technical aspect of interviewing, crafting cold outreach, researching companies and people, and honing in on your story for when you meet these people.

Now let's practice!

For this activity you'll pair with each person in your cohort once. Take two minutes to tell your story. At the end of that two minutes your partner will spend 1.5 minutes giving you feedback. Switch. They now will tell their story for two minutes. You'll give feedback for 1.5 minutes.

Repeat this with each cohort mate.

The goal is to improve on your storytelling. You won't always have a lot of time to get your story across to those you meet, spend time narrowing it down to two minutes!
