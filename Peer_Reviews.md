#Peer Reviews
###Resume Review -
<p>In this exercise you'll have 20 minutes with your partner to review and give feedback on their resume. While reviewing, consider these questions:
<ul>
<li>Does the resume include the basic essentials discussed?</li>
<li>Does the resume encompass transferrable skills?</li>
<li>Is the resume one page for every ten years?</li>
<li>Are the bullet points action oriented?</li>
<li>Do projects link out?</li>
<li>Are there things you know about your pair that you don't get from reading their resume?</li>
</ul>
Repeat this with your second pair.

###LinkedIn Review -

<p>Similar to the Resume Review, you'll have 20 minutes with your partner to review and give feedback on their LinkedIn profile. While reviewing, consider these questions:
<ul>
<li>Is there a title that makes sense and is effectively branding your partner?</li>
<li>Have they created a vanity URL?</li>
<li>Is the experience written anecdotally rather than bullet points?</li>
<li>Does the summary tell an effective story of how they got to a place where they're now applying for a dev role?</li>
<li>Do they have a professional headshot?</li>
<li>Is it inviting viewers to connect with?</li>
</ul>
Repeat this with your second pair.

Once you have completed two pair reviews for your resume and two pair reviews for your LinkedIn, implement these changes in our workshopping session after lunch.

Your resume and LinkedIn profile will be due to me by Thursday morning before we start at 10am.
